									<h2>Dear friend,</h2>
									<p>I'm writing this from bottom of my heart.I feel ashamed of myself for not fulfilling my promise and I am profoundly sorry.</p>
								</header>
								<hr />
								<p>It had been a long time since our last conversation 
									It had been a long time since we last talked, I remember promising you something which would have been very beneficial for both of us and in terms would have been very fruitful, we both agreed on it. BUT I failed myself in delivering my promise and in the process failed your very dream that could have been. I can understand if you are still angry for what I did and do not trust my words for that I only blame myself, you have every right to be enraged as I have not been a good friend. </p>
								<p>I know you must loath me now, and I understand you don't want anything to do with me. My friend, I am writing to say that I am deeply sorry for hurting your feelings. I did the one thing that I swore never to do. It was stupid of me, and I know I disappointed you. Please, please, please forgive me. Our friendship means the world to me, and I wouldn't want to lose you. I know it took me a long time to reach you, I didn't have enough courage to reach you I was in a passive self-centered state and had no regards for my life I was in a bad shape when it all happened, I wanted to tell you all about it but I was too afraid to gather the courage to talk even now I am afraid. I had been very depressed for a year now all that I thought of doing all my ambitions , expectations, and failure to adjust to the lockdown regime hit very hard I used to consider myself a very brave, courageous, and courteous human being turns out I am not as brave I thought It was very difficult to eliminate the problem when the problem is within your lurking and slowly eating you from inside like a blood-sucking parasite but instead of blood it sucks your own consciousness and with that your self-confidence shatters and without you realizing you are no longer in control and the devil inside is eats away your will power.</p>
